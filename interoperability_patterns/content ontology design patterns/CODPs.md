A List of patterns that can be reused to organise disaster data in the context of uganda have been elaborated the publication the Authors presented at the 28th WETICE IEEE conference

some of these patterns  are listed here.


Pattern   | Name |Competency questions
:------:|-------------------:|-----------------------:
1| Event Pattern | 1-Where did hazard occur in 2013? <br/> 2-Which hazards occurred between 2013 and 2018 in Uganda? <br/> 3-When did the 2010 hazard (e.g landslide) take place? when is it expected to occur
2|Place Pattern | 1-Where did hazard event occur? <br/> 2-Which areas are prone to hazards?
3|Organisation, agent Role patterns| 1-Which organizations are stakeholders in disaster Organisation, management? e.g Government of Uganda <br/> 2-Who are the actors/agents involved in disaster management? <br/> 3-What role do the actors perform? E.g donors, response etc. 
4|Activity Specificaction patterns|1-What event is likely to be triggered by changes Activity in another event e.g Extreme weather event specification (EWE)? (Cascading/compound/complex disasters) <br/> 2-What activity is triggered by a change in weather events? e.g rockfall triggered by EWE <br/> 3-What activity triggers an event/state? e.g rockfall triggers landslide <br/> What class of objects could satisfy
precondition for rockfall? e.g above average rainfall leads to a rockfall <br/> 4- What triggers DRF for a hazard event?
5|value partitions pattern | 1-What are the elements at risk when the hazard occurs? E.g crops, built up areas <br/> quantified with land cover/ land use
