# POLARISCO

POLARISC Ontologies (POLARISCO) is a modular ontology that defines the Knowledge of French emergency responders that are involved in the disaster response process.

POLARISCO is devoloped in the context of the French project POLARISC ("Plateforme OpérationnelLe d’Actualisation du Renseignement Interservices pour la Sécurité Civile").

POLARISC project started in 2017 to propose an ontology-based crisis information management system for operational disaster response.

POLARISCO extends from Basic Formal Ontology (BFO: https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology) as an upper-level ontology and Common Core Ontologies (CCO: https://github.com/BFO-ontology) as a mid-level ontologies, and reuse classes from Public Safety and Emergency Management ontology (PS/EM ontology) and Disease Ontoogy (DO).

POLARISCO is composed of a set of ontologies including:
*	POLARISC Common Core ontology,
*	Firefighters ontology,
* Healthcare units ontology,
*	Police ontology,
*	Gendarmerie ontology,
*	Public Authorities ontology,
*	Messages ontology,
*	Healthcare resources ontology.
