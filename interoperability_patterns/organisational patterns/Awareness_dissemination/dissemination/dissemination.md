DESCRIPTION:
Organisational awareness about the benefits of new business and
technology paradigms is an important factor when considering the ehealth systems in the context of their evolutionary and emergent
aspects.
The purpose of this pattern is to provide effective, efficient and continual
dissemination of information about best practices, standards and new
approaches to all e-health stakeholders.
SOLUTION:
There are three key parts to this pattern:
– Type of dissemination ‘channels’ for delivering information, such as
Web, direct mail, or handouts at events;
– Type of medium for disseminating information such as online or
paper documents, machine readable format, audio, video or
presentation slides;
– Type of information that is distributed, such as e-health
specifications, standards profiles, guidelines, and methodologies.
This structure allows the construction of certain specific solutions by
combining these three parameters depending on the context, e.g.
handout of e-health specifications using online documents at an event,
or on the Web, or audio about some recent technology at an event, or
on the Web
