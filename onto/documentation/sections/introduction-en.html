The world is changing fast with increasing numbers of both
natural and man-made hazards that expose vast vulnerable
communities to adverse impacts. Haigh and Amaratunga [12]
discuss the need for an integrative approach to disaster management that involves multi-sectoral collaboration to ensure
proper management and resourcing of pre-disaster, disaster
and post-disaster effort. The success of the integrated disaster
management approach depends on the ability of multiple
stakeholders to share information so that the right people can
make the right decisions at the right time. However, disasterrelated information held by different stakeholders is heterogeneous and described in multiple schemas, markup languages,
with different vocabularies and conceptualizations. Ontology design
patterns (ODPs) have been proposed as proven best practices, that are
flexible, reusable building blocks for modelling reoccurring
tasks [3] thus critical for managing interoperability between
heterogeneous data sources. This sections presents antology generated from ODPs for managing disaster data interoperability.
