The success of disaster risk management efforts
depend on the ability of multiple stakeholders to share disasterrelated information. Semantic integration of such heterogeneous
information requires ontology building. The top-down-approach
of ontology building has several disadvantages to knowledge
representation. To support the process of ontology engineering,
a bottom-up-approach that utilizes modular Ontology Design
Patterns (ODPs) with weak dependencies can be used to overcome
the disadvantages of the top-down-approach. To bridge the
availability gap of patterns for representing disaster knowledge,
the study identifies existing and emerging patterns that can be
used to organize disaster knowledge.
