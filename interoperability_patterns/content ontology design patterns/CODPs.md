A List of patterns that can be reused to organise disaster data in the context of uganda have been elaborated the publication the Authors presented at the 28th WETICE IEEE conference

some of these patterns  are listed here.


Pattern   | Name |Competency questions
:------:|-------------------:|-----------------------:
1| Event Pattern | 1-Where did hazard occur in 2013? <br/> 2-Which hazards occurred between 2013 and 2018 in Uganda? <br/> 3-When did the 2010 hazard (e.g landslide) take place? when is it expected to occur
2|Place Pattern | 1-Where did hazard event occur? <br/> 2-Which areas are prone to hazards?

Problem  | |
Solution | a user is able to access multiple disaster data repositories based on a single query using a single interface known uses. The decision on how best to provide this unified view are often set against the availability of tooling, experience, expertise and  organizational policies. | data integration, SOA 
Example solution | e.g A user using a query to integrate impact data from  DesInventar, Em-database and Average rainfall from the meteorological department to generate early warnings for potentially risk areas.
