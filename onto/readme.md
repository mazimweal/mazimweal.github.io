Ontology Design patterns for Representing disaster Knowledge
===================
The world is changing fast with increasing numbers of both natural and man-made hazards that expose vast vulnerable
communities to adverse impacts. An integrative approach to disaster management that involves multi-sectoral collaboration to ensure
proper management and resourcing of pre-disaster, disaster and post-disaster effort is required. The success of the integrated disaster
management approach depends on the ability of multiple stakeholders to share information so that the right people can  make the right decisions at the right time. However, disasterrelated information held by different stakeholders is heterogeneous and described in multiple schemas, markup languages, with different vocabularies and conceptualizations


Role of Ontology Design Patterns.
===================
Ontologies can be used to provide a unified semantic representation of the domain, along with superior capabilities in querying and information retrieval. Ontology design patterns (ODPs) have been proposed as proven best practices, that are flexible, reusable building blocks for modelling reoccurring tasks thus critical for managing interoperability between heterogeneous data sources. Patterns can also be combined and ultimately aligned with foundational ontologies that act as glue between patterns, making it easy for domain experts to integrate disaster knowledge without the assistance of knowledge engineers. 

Emerging Patterns
==========
To bridge the availability gap of patterns for representing disaster knowledge, we identify existing and emerging patterns that can be used to organize disaster knowledge. Work in progress ...
