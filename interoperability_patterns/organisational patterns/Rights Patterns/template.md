Rights policy
Policy statements of rights are used in many situations to denote ownership, moral rights, copyrights, entitlements etc. on disaster data/information

However, rights are often used interchangeably with the concept of permission although they involve higher complexity than permissions. Typically, they imply additional constraints on the behaviour of others in addition to the permissions for right-holders


Solution
Organisational Rights pattern consists of the following elements
A role of right-holder (e.g. patient in a public hospital), a role representing the other party (e.g. doctor in an emergency department), and an authority role, describing the initial granting of the rights (e.g. government granting all citizens the rights to healthcare); 
– a permission that applies to the role of right-holder to perform some actions
an obligation that applies to the role of right-grantor, with respect to the specified action; – action to which the rights apply. This pattern can be applied in a number of situations, to describe permissions, prohibitions and obligations associated with all parties involved in granting and respecting rights of right-holders.
